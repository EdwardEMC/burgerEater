# Burger Eater

An application for burgers! Using MySQL, Node.js and express to make a basic tracking app for burgers; creating, updating and delete user input for burger names and being able to 'devour them'.

The landing page consists of the waiting area where newly created burgers are stored and the devoured area with a form underneath the two areas for inputing new burgers. Once devoured the user can recreate the burger by clicking the 'make it again' button.

Each of these actions are quering the MySQL database and changed the information appropriately.

Each of the burgers can be deleted from the page and database with the 'delete' button poised next to each burger.
